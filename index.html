            <h2>Technologies Affect on Society</h2>
              <p>There's a question that has been irritating the deep recesses of my brain lately. The answer to this question is certainly not simple or specific in any way.</p>

              <p><strong>Does technology have a positive or negative effect on society?</strong></p>
              
              <p>I believe this question can be broken down into several smaller questions that can be combined to form a general conclusion. First question I consider is: <em>Could the world live without technology?</em> This is sort of a trick question because the answer is yes and no. Yes we <em>could</em> live without it, but in the world today, if every piece of technology was snapped out of existence this very second, millions of people would be without jobs, millions of people would suddenly be staring at the ground instead of their phone, and lots of lives would be lost due to the lack of medical technology. In those past three examples I immediately find one advantage to technology and that is areas like medical technology. Statistics show that medical technology helped <strong>add five years</strong> to the average U.S. life expectancy, since 1980 disability rates have <strong>declined by 25%</strong>, and between 1980 and 2010 advanced medical technology helped reduce the number of days spent in hospitals by <strong>59%</strong>. If we look at that bearing in mind to our role to subdue and have dominion of the earth, I could believe technology is 100% amazing!</p>
              
              <p>Well, not quite. Then comes the second example I listed: smartphones. When I say millions of people would suddenly be staring at the ground if phones didn't exist, I believe I'm not too far off. I'm actually quite short in my guess. Here are the current smartphone stats: the global population has <strong>6.92 billion</strong> smartphone users. Thats <strong>86.29%</strong> of the entire population. The average American spends roughly 5 hours on their phone every day. If said American gets 8 hours of sleep per day, then they spend 16 hours awake. That means they spend almost one third of they're awake time looking at a box of LEDs. Here's where my opinions blur.</p> 
              
              <p>We've all heard the quote that goes something like "too much of a good thing is a bad thing", or "everything in moderation". If you think through your daily life, these quotes really glow true and I believe they need more attention. The simple fact that Americans spend one third of their day on their phone is sickening. Where did human interaction go? Where did family go? Where did <em>God</em> go? 89% of Americans say they check their phone within the first 10 minutes of waking up. Its almost comical to me the numbers that are used. God commands us to give Him the first fruits of our day, and the term "first fruits" is used to describe the first 10% of your harvest. See any relationship? God tells us to give Him the first fruits (<strong>10%</strong>) of our day, while most Americans check they're phone within the <strong>first 10 minutes</strong> of their day. I repeat: where did God go?</p>
              
              <p>To conclude this rabbit trail, I have no problem with smartphones, in fact I believe they are amazing tools that when used well can positively benefit society. But, when not used well, can be a snare just waiting to trap us. A quote from a sermon on the fear of man comes to mind:</p>
              
              <p><em>"Social media is a two-edged sword, and the good edge is small" - Phil Sasser</em></p>
              
              <p>This quote specifically discusses social media, but I gather it can apply to smartphones in general as well. Our world has abused the amazing tool of technology we have in smartphones. There are so many ways we can use it to glorify God that people abuse. Even social media apps <em>could</em> be used to spread God's word, but with so much worldly influence I'm inclined to flee from them.</p>
